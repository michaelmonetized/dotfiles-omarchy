    SCHEMA_DOC = <<~DOC
      Rule JSON schema (schemaVersion 1). Top-level fields: schemaVersion (1), id (lowercase slug), name (short), enabled (true), trigger, conditions (optional array, max 5), actions (array, max 10), while (optional array of reactions live only between the opening fire and the until), until (optional lifecycle ending block), cooldownSeconds (optional, default 60), source (the original user request verbatim).
      Triggers (exactly one):
        {"type":"manual"}
        {"type":"time","at":"HH:MM","days":["mon".."sun"] (optional)}
        {"type":"interval","minutes":N} — fires roughly every N minutes (1..1440, integer); omit cooldownSeconds, the interval is the spacing. Use ONLY for genuinely periodic work (reminders, recurring checks). NEVER use interval to poll for a state change that an event trigger covers: connecting to wifi is wifi-connected, a branch switch is git-branch-changed, a new file is file-created, an app appearing is app-opened. When the request says "when X happens", pick the trigger that fires on X itself.
        {"type":"lid-opened"}
        {"type":"lid-closed"}
        {"type":"monitor-connected","match":{"description":"<substring>"}} (or match.name)
        {"type":"monitor-disconnected","match":{"description":"<substring>"}} (or match.name)
        {"type":"app-opened","match":{"class":"<substring>"}} (or match.title)
        {"type":"app-closed","match":{"class":"<substring>"}} (or match.title)
        {"type":"wifi-connected","match":{"ssid":"<substring or *>"}} or {"type":"wifi-connected","match":{"known":false}} for never-seen networks
        {"type":"wifi-disconnected"} — optional match {"ssid":"<substring>"} reacts only when that network is the one lost
        {"type":"power-source","source":"ac"|"battery"}
        {"type":"file-created","path":"~/Downloads","match":{"name":"<substring>"}} (match optional) — path must start with ~/ or / and name matching is a case-insensitive substring; {{name}} and {{path}} are available
        {"type":"folder-created","path":"~/Downloads","match":{"name":"<substring>"}} (match optional) — path must start with ~/ or / and name matching is a case-insensitive substring; {{name}} and {{path}} are available
        {"type":"git-branch-changed","repo":"~/Documents/code/project","match":{"branch":"<substring>"}} (match optional) — repo must start with ~/ or /, be at most 200 chars, and contain no .. segment; branch matching is a case-insensitive substring, detached HEAD is reported as detached, and {{branch}}, {{from}}, and {{repo}} are available
        {"type":"custom","name":"<lowercase slug>"} — fires through omaflow trigger <name> [key=value ...]; {{at}} is the envelope timestamp
      Conditions (all must hold at fire time):
        {"type":"time-between","from":"HH:MM","to":"HH:MM"}
        {"type":"weekday","days":[...]}
        {"type":"on-power","source":"ac"|"battery"}
        {"type":"lid-state","state":"open"|"closed"}
        {"type":"monitor-present","match":{"description":"<substring>"}} (or match.name)
        {"type":"app-running","match":{"class":"<substring>"}} (or match.title)
        {"type":"on-branch","repo":"~/Documents/code/project","branch":"<substring>"} — repo follows the same path rules and branch matching is a case-insensitive substring
        {"type":"hey-events","atLeast":N} — true when HEY has at least N events today (integer 1..50)
        {"type":"on-ssid","ssid":"<substring>"}
      App class/title matching is a case-insensitive substring match against the selected field; prefer stable class fragments such as zoom, slack, or firefox.
      Actions (executed in order):
        {"type":"theme","name":"<installed theme>"}
        {"type":"dnd","state":"on"|"off"}
        {"type":"nightlight","state":"on"|"off"}
        {"type":"stay-awake","state":"on"|"off"}
        {"type":"launch","app":"<app name>","workspace":N (optional)}
        {"type":"workspace","number":N}
        {"type":"audio-output","match":"<sink description substring>"}
        {"type":"script","name":"<allowed script name>"} — runs one exact packaged or user-approved executable. name must be from the allowed scripts inventory; no path, arguments, or shell text are permitted in a rule.
        {"type":"webhook","endpoint":"<configured endpoint name>","message":"<text>"} — POSTs the message to a user-configured endpoint. endpoint must be one of the configured webhook names; never a URL.
        {"type":"hey-timetrack","mode":"start"|"stop"|"switch","category":"<text>" (optional),"categoryFromRepo":"<repo path>" (optional)} — category and categoryFromRepo are mutually exclusive; category supports event templating such as {{branch}}, and categoryFromRepo resolves the repo's current branch at trigger time
        {"type":"hey-agenda","title":"<text>" (optional, default Today),"skipWhenEmpty":true|false (optional, default true)} — notifies with today's HEY events
        {"type":"notify","title":"<short>" (optional),"message":"<text>"}
        {"type":"agent","task":"<what to do>","can":["close-window"|"focus-window"|"move-window-to-workspace"|"notify"],"timeoutSeconds":N (optional, default 120)} — runs an agent at trigger time and costs tokens; task max 300, can is non-empty, timeoutSeconds 10..180, and cooldownSeconds at least 60. Grant only the minimum verbs needed.
      Until (optional): {"trigger":<same trigger schema except manual>,"revert":true (optional),"actions":[<same action schema, 1..10>] (optional)} requires revert:true, actions, or both and arms only after the rule's opening actions succeed. A later matching event restores the opening snapshot first when revert is true, then runs any closing actions once and disarms, ignoring the rule's conditions and cooldown. Use it when the request describes one lifecycle such as "when X ... until Y ...". An interval until means a one-shot timeout N minutes after the most recent successful opening fire, not a repeating schedule.
      While (optional, requires until): [{"trigger":<same trigger schema except manual>,"actions":[<same action schema, 1..10>]}, ...] is an array of 1..5 reactions that are live only while the rule is armed, between the opening fire and the until. Each reaction runs its actions whenever its trigger matches, without arming, disarming, or checking the rule's conditions and cooldown; an interval reaction repeats every N minutes while armed, paced on its own. Use it when things should keep happening inside a state, such as "while I'm on office wifi, switch tracking whenever the branch changes and remind me to look away every 20 minutes".
      When the request says restore/undo/back to normal, prefer revert over mirror actions; for example, Zoom opening can turn DND on and {"revert":true} on Zoom closing restores the prior DND state, so DND remains on if it was already on.
      Lifecycle example: {"schemaVersion":1,"id":"office-tracking","name":"Office tracking","enabled":true,"trigger":{"type":"wifi-connected","match":{"ssid":"Office"}},"actions":[{"type":"hey-timetrack","mode":"start","category":"Work"}],"until":{"trigger":{"type":"wifi-disconnected"},"actions":[{"type":"hey-timetrack","mode":"stop"}]},"source":"start tracking on office wifi until it disconnects"}
      Lifecycle with while example: {"schemaVersion":1,"id":"office-branch-tracking","name":"Office branch tracking","enabled":true,"trigger":{"type":"wifi-connected","match":{"ssid":"Office"}},"actions":[{"type":"hey-timetrack","mode":"switch","categoryFromRepo":"~/Documents/code/project"}],"while":[{"trigger":{"type":"git-branch-changed","repo":"~/Documents/code/project"},"actions":[{"type":"hey-timetrack","mode":"switch","categoryFromRepo":"~/Documents/code/project"}]},{"trigger":{"type":"interval","minutes":20},"actions":[{"type":"notify","title":"20-20-20","message":"Look away for 20 seconds."}]}],"until":{"trigger":{"type":"wifi-disconnected"},"actions":[{"type":"hey-timetrack","mode":"stop"}]},"source":"on office wifi track the current branch, switch when it changes, remind me to look away every 20 minutes, stop when I leave"}
      In notify and webhook messages, hey-timetrack category, and agent tasks {{trigger}} is replaced with a description of the firing event. In notify and webhook messages and hey-timetrack category every event data key is also available as {{key}}, including {{class}}, {{title}}, {{ssid}}, {{name}}, {{path}}, {{repo}}, {{branch}}, {{from}}, {{source}}, {{at}}, and custom event keys. Unknown placeholders become empty strings; agent tasks support only {{trigger}}.
      hey actions talk to the HEY service at trigger time and need hey auth login once
      Constraints: all name/match/message strings must be plain text with no control characters and must not start with "-"; name max 80 chars, messages max 200 (webhook: 400); cooldownSeconds and workspace numbers must be integers; no fields other than the ones shown.
      No other trigger, condition, or action types exist. Never invent fields.
